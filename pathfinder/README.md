Author: Kyle Hagerman, hagermak@mcmaster.ca
Rationale: Developing a pathfinder algorithm for the shortest path between nodes, and allows users to extend and develop their own

1. Create a new class which implements the pathfinder interface
2. Develop your own algorithm which follows the contract of the pathfinder interface's method
