## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with the feature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator 
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % 
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go to the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```
To visualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tools like `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog

### Definition of Done

-- Each feature compiles properly on maven, functioning both on the generation side and the visualizing side, following all necessary business requirements.  --

## ideas
new class to handle user input (is given dotgen and string args[], returns a mesh)
call dotgen, which accepts all the arguments, but new class sets values to default for ones that are not provided

to do:
1. new class to do all this
2. modify dotgen and subsequent classes to use these new values passed in rather than hard coded


# Documentation
To get thickness of vertices and lines, extract the thickness from the properties list using the key 'thickness'.

## Format for user input when running generator main file
- Different arguments accepted depending on if using a grid or an irregular mesh.
- For a grid, that is the default, for an irregular mesh, use '-ir'.
- For help mode, enter '-h' or '--help' as the first argument (and it will be the only one considered if used).  
- For changing anything from default values, consult legend for command to use, and then insert value wanted after a space.  
- For relaxation level, the value specifies the number of times lloyd relaxation is applied.

## Legend
- -ir = use an irregular mesh instead of grid
- -pa = polygon transparency (0 to 255) (default = 255)
- -sa = segment transparency (0 to 255) (default = 255)
- -va = vertex transparency (0 to 255) (default = 255)
- -pt = polygon thickness (default = 0.5)
- -st = segment thickness (default = 0.5)
- -vt = vertex thickness (default = 3)

Only applicable in irregular mesh
- -np = number of polygons (default = 100)
- -rl = number of relaxations (default = 0)

## Grid
outputFile (extra commands from legend)

### Example
User wants output file sample.mesh, polygon transparency of 200, and segment thickness of 10
sample.mesh -pa 200 -st 10

## Irregular
outputFile -ir (extra commands from legend)

### Example
User wants output file sample.mesh, 200 polygons, relaxed mesh 5 times, polygon transparency of 200, and segment thickness of 10
sample.mesh -ir -np 200 -rl 5 -pa 200 -st 10

## Format for user input when running visualizer main file
Add '-X' after first 2 arguments to enter debug mode. Anything else is taken as default visualization.
